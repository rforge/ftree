\title{ Define an uncertainty deviate for a selected basic element in the fault tree. }

\description{Modifies an existing fault tree with the addition of the repeated nodes.}

\usage{
applyUncertainty(DF, on, what="prob", deviate, param)
}

\arguments{
\item{DF}{ A fault tree dataframe such as returned from ftree.make or related add... functions.}
\item{on}{ The ID of the basic element node to be defined uncertain.}
\item{what}{A string identifying the basic-event parameter that uncertainty is to be applied to. Only default of "prob" has been implemented.}
\item{deviate}{A string signifying the deviate to be applied. Implemented deviate types "uniform","normal","lognormal" have been implemented.}
\item{param}{A vector of the appropriate deviate parameters in the order sepcified in the Open-PSA Model Exchange Format}
}

\value{
Returns the input fault tree dataframe amended with entries defining an uncertainty deviate for the probability of the  selected event.
}

\details{
  Application of the deviate has no impact on the tree visualization or functionality, except to provide input for uncertainty analysis by the SCRAM program.
  SCRAM is an external program that must be installed on the system. Package FaultTree.SCRAM has been developed to facilitate interoperatility between the FaultTree package and SCRAM.
  SCRAM implements the Open-PSA Model Exchange Format, which defines the deviate parameters. Three uncertainty deviates types have been implemented as per the MEF documentation.
  The deviate type argument entries can be "uniform", "normal", or "lognormal". The parameters are passed in the param argument as a vector in the order as discussed in the MEF documentation
  except that the mean (probability in all cases) has already been entered in the basic element entry such as the addProbability,  prob argument. So, only the remaining parameters are
  entered in the param argument to applyUncertainty. For uniform-deviate the param=c([lower_bound_value], [upper_bound_value]). For the normal-deviate only the std deviation value is provided
  as a single param. For the lognormal-deviate parameters are entered for the Err and confidence limit as documented for the MEF. Since the lower and upper bounds to the uniform-deviate must
  exactly straddle the mean, it is wise to enter them as c(mean-half_range, mean+half_range).
