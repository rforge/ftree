\description{Line-by-line text parsing of a known XML presentation format. 
}

\usage{
readSCRAMuncertainty(x, dir="", show=c(FALSE, FALSE))
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{ The local file name of SCRAM output of interest.}
\item{dir}{A character string for an absolute directory in which R can read and write.}
\item{show}{A logigal vector determining whether to display [1] a histogram or [2] a plot of upper and lower bounds by quantile obtained from uncertainty analysis.}
}

\value{
Returns a list containing $probability, $quantiles, and $histogram data from uncertainty analysis.
}

\details{
SCRAM produces a consistently formated report for uncertainty analysis. This is parsed on a line-by-line basis to extract the returned data items.
