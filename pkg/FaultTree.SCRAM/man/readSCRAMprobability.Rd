\title{ Parse SCRAM output files to extract probability result }

\description{Line-by-line text parsing of a known XML presentation format.
}

\usage{
readSCRAMprobability(x, dir="")
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{ The local file name of SCRAM output of interest.}
\item{dir}{A character string for an absolute directory in which R can read and write.}
}

\value{
Returns a scalar vector (single value) which is the exact probability calculation via BDD analysis.
}

\details{
SCRAM produces a consistently formated report for probability analysis. This is parsed on a line-by-line basis to extract the probability result.
