\title{ Parse SCRAM output files to extract minimal cutset results }

\description{Line-by-line text parsing of a known XML presentation format.
}

\usage{
readSCRAMcutsets(x, dir="")
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{ The local file name of SCRAM output of interest.}
\item{dir}{A character string for an absolute directory in which R can read and write.}
}

\value{
Returns a list of matrices containing tags of minimal cutsets. Each matrix on the list contains
 cutsets of a specific order, which is also the list item number.
}

\details{
SCRAM produces consistently formated reports from each minimal cutset method: mocus, bdd, and zbdd. 
These are parsed on a line-by-line basis to extract the tag names as qualitative data from these analyses.
