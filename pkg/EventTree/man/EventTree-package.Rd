\description{
A package for constructing, calculating and displaying event trees.

\section{Introduction}{
	\pkg{EvetTree} provides functions for building tree structures as dataframe objects.
	Event trees are a simple arrangment of initiating event followed by a series of 
	mitigating controls. Each mitigating control has a complimentary hazard state
	corresponding to failure of the control. End nodes can be labeled as outcome events.
	Display of the tree is generated in HTML using the D3 javascript library.
