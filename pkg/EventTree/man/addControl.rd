\item{at}{ The ID of the parent node for this addition.}
\item{prob}{The probability of success for this mitigating control}
\item{severity}{Severity level upon successful outcome of this control. Severity does not enter into any calculation, but will be passed down to complimentary hazard states.}
\item{name}{ A short identifying string }
\item{description}{ An optional string providing more detail for the mitigating control action.}
\item{overwrite}{A logical entry indicating whether this control should overwrite the 'hazard' outcome it is connecting to.}
