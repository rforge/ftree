\usage{
ftree2json(DF, data.col=c(2), dir="", write_file=FALSE )
}

\arguments{
\item{DF}{ A FaultTree dataframe object.}
\item{data.col}{ A vector of column numbers from the FaultTree dataframe to be passed as json data.}
\item{dir}{A character string for an absolute directory in which R can read and write.}
\item{write_file}{A logical controlling whether to perform the write operation.}
}
