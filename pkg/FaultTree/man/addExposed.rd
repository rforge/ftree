\title{ Add a Pure Probability }

\description{Adds a basic component event to a fault tree in which probability of failure 
 is defined by fail rate and exposure time.}

\usage{
addExposed(DF, at, mttf, exposure=NULL, dist="exponential", param=NULL,
		display_under=NULL, tag="", name="",name2="", description="")
}

\arguments{
\item{DF}{ A fault tree dataframe such as returned from ftree.make or related add... functions.}
\item{at}{ The ID of the parent node for this addition.}
\item{mttf}{The mean time to failure.  It is the user's responsibility to maintain constant units of time.}
\item{exposure}{The mission time over which a system is exposed to failure. If a mission_time object exists in the global environment this will be used, while default of NULL is maintained for this arguement.}
\item{dist}{The probabilty distribution to be used for defining probability of failure from mttf, and a possible extra parameter. Default is "exponential", expected implementation of "weibull" to follow.}
\item{param}{A placeholder for additional parameter for other distributions. Not yet implemented.}
\item{display_under}{Optionally, the ID of a sibling event under an OR gate for vertical alignment of the component node in the graphic display.}
\item{tag}{ A very short identifying string (typically 5 characters or less) uniquely identifying a basic event for minimal cutset evaluation}
\item{name}{ A short identifying string  (typically less than 24 characters)}
\item{name2}{ A second line, if needed for the identifying string label}
\item{description}{ An optional string providing more detail for this probability.}
}

\value{
Returns the input fault tree dataframe appended with an entry row for the defined failure event.
